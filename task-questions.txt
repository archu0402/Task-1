*********For Archana********
so far you have done upto 2x2 averaging

Questions:
1.Create averaging image for 3x3 (i-1,i,i+1,j-1,j,j+1)
2. In a grayscale image, use mask of M=[[0 0 0][1 1 1][0 0 0]] multiply with 3x3 from the pic and plot the image
3. Use different masks(I will tell the masks once you complete 2nd Ques)  
4. Do convolution and maxpooling on RGB image.

task-2

Task 2 for Archana:


2a) apply all 12 kernals from the below link and plot all original and convoluted image
http://aishack.in/tutorials/image-convolution-examples/


2b) write a function which takes image as argument and return convoluted image (any kernal).

2c) write 10 functions, each has different kernals from above link and return convoluted image. 

2d) write a code to save all 10 convoluted image in a folder.
